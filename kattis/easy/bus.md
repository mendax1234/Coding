# Bus

## Question

## Solution

### Idea

This is another **math** problem. A tricky point is the in this question, there is a chance that "half" of a passenger (horrible :scream:) may get off the bus. But as stated in the question, there is no passenger hurt. So, it is safe for you to start from the **last** stop.
