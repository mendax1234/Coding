# Vim

For now, I use Vim to write my code on WSL (that's because [CS1010](https://wenbo-notes.gitbook.io/cs1010-notes) uses vim :joy:). So, I decide to migrate the vim setup from CS1010 on my pc.

## Ubuntu

Since setting up vim and managing plugins on Windows is tedious and not elegant. I decide to use Vim on my WSL (Ubuntu).
